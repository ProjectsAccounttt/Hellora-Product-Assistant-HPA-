## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project stems from the growing complexity of managing and analyzing vast product catalogs in the retail and cosmetics industries. Brands and businesses often struggle to extract meaningful insights from thousands of customer reviews, product ratings, and feedback. Traditional methods of data analysis are time-consuming and inefficient, leading to missed opportunities for strategic decision-making and product development. We envisioned a solution that leverages cutting-edge technologies like **graph databases**, **GPU-accelerated analytics**, and **natural language processing (NLP)** to transform this process. By combining these technologies, we aimed to create a tool that not only simplifies data analysis but also empowers businesses to make smarter, faster decisions.

## What It Does

The **Hellora Product Assistant (HPA)** is an advanced AI-powered analytics platform designed to help businesses unlock the full potential of their product data. It allows users to ask complex questions in plain language, such as:

- "Which products have the highest customer satisfaction for dry skin?"
- "What are the most common complaints about our top-selling moisturizers?"
- "Which ingredients are trending in positive reviews?"

The platform processes these queries using **graph-based analytics** and **GPU-accelerated algorithms**, delivering actionable insights in seconds. It also provides **interactive visualizations** and **personalized recommendations**, enabling businesses to optimize their product strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
